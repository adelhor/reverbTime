# Acoustic Reverberation Time
The program allows to calculate the reverberation time of chosen space.
In the first step the user adds the type of the space and the volume. In the next step can see the database of materials and their absorption coefficients or start adding the surface and the size.
The user can also add new material to database, becuase can use only material included in database.
