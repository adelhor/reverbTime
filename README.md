# Acoustic Engineering Utilities

This Python project comprises several utilities for acoustic engineering applications, including database management, main processing, and reverberation time calculation.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application. It integrates various modules and executes the program.
- `DB.py`: Handles database operations, ensuring that data is correctly managed and queried.
- `reverbTime.py`: Provides functionality to calculate the reverberation time, a critical parameter in acoustics.
